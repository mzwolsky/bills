# Bill 1: Mom-&-Pop Store, 1970-01-01
A	BC	2.00	# A paid 2.00, benefiting B and C
A	A	5.00	# A paid 5.00, but only for themselves
A	ABC	10.00	# A paid 10.00, and whatever was bought got split evenly.
# Bill 2
B	A	2.00
B	AB	3.00
# Cash exchange
C	B	8.88	# C gave B some cash

# The algorithm is to track an "account" for each person:
# Whenever they pay something, subtract that from their account
# Whenever they receive something, add that to their account.
# Once all transactions are tracked, shovel cash from people with positive
# balances to people with negative balances until everyone reaches 0.

# Compile and run the script to figure out how to get even:
# ghc bills.hs -o bills
# ./bills < bills.txt

# Output:
# B pays 5.1666665 to A
# B pays 4.5466666 to C
